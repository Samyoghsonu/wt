        Alumni feeling that they want to give back something to their school or college which helped us grow so much to build their career and where they learnt so much and grew as people. but those feelings tend to stay as feelings and don't actually get realized. So what we planned to do God Willingly is to create a website that allows alumni students to connect with present students to share their experience, knowledge and give valuable advices to those who are currently experiencing what they have already experienced. Not only that it also allows other alumni students to connect with each other.
